<p>This is something that I&rsquo;ve been annoyed about for the past few years. Now that I&rsquo;m actually blogging I thought I should make a post about it. So I&rsquo;m currently paying for&nbsp;100/10 with a cap at 300GB. Yeah, I know <strong>300GB</strong>. Even though I disagree with caps (especially that low), I believe the higher speeds you get you should have a significantly larger-cap if any at all. For example, if you rent a server from x host they usually charge ~$5 per 3TB etc of bandwidth. I know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISPs </a>and a server company are a bit different, but bandwidth should be cheap for regular consumers. (My ISP does $10 per 50GB)</p>
<p>Like on my connection I should get 2TB /m or at least 1TB /m. I usually go to 350GB /m and sometimes more &ndash; depending on what I&rsquo;ve done that month.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of anything else to put on here currently, so I&rsquo;ll end on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
