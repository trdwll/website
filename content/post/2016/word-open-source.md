<p>I've been writing code since I was 15 and I've always loved it. I only recently started to open-source my code (the last 2 years) and my experience is rather great. I don't have other people contributing to my projects, but it's there if people would like to or whatever. I started open-sourcing my code to not only get other developers in on the development but to show what I'm capable of and to show my learning progress as I write the said application.</p>
<p>Now that I'm involved with git (using it day-to-day), I love open source even more. I don't really contribute to any other projects, but I do try to open source everything I work on if possible. By open-sourcing code, you open the doors for other developers to <a href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn and collaborate</a>.</p>
<h3>Where can I get started in open source?</h3>
<p>Well, just browse on <a href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> to find a project that you'd like to contribute to. You don't necessarily have to contribute to another project, you can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create your own</a>.</p>
<p>You don't have to use GitHub either, there's plenty of other sites that use git that have projects.</p>
<p>Over the next year, I hope to release more software as open source.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
