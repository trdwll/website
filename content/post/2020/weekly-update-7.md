<p>Monday and Tuesday I picked up sticks (there was a high wind storm over the weekend) at my day job and Wednesday I pumped out bunkers (again holding water due to the storm) and then started raking the bunkers. Thursday I finished raking the bunkers with an hour of overtime and today I mowed collars again. I then worked on cleaning up 8 fairway (has mud on it due to water running over it during construction/heavy rains since).</p>
<p>Over the weekend I worked on this site a very small amount and I also worked some on HordeMode, but I still haven't committed yet. As I say every week I plan to work on x project and I never really do so I'll not say that this time and I'll update you again next week. ðŸ˜›</p>
<p>Some exciting news happened on the 14th, <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-14-github-is-now-free-for-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub is now free</a>. So that's really cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
