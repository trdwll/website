<p>So this week again wasn't really productive. Starting on Monday I attended my aunt's funeral. Tuesday was a great day - I started back at my day job. The rest of the week was just day job stuff while I get back into the routine. Wednesday I received my Oculus Rift so that's very exciting - I'm very excited to work more on Shifted (a VR game that I'm contracting on).</p>
