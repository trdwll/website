<p>So every year people decide what they&#39;re going to try and do in the new year and usually it&#39;s stuff like go to the gym more or eat healthier. While those are mine every year also we all don&#39;t stick to it and fall back into old habits.</p>

<p>This year I have some NYR that I really hope I can make some of them happen.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Release a video game</li>
	<li>Maybe join the military</li>
	<li>Lose some weight, ~30lbs</li>
	<li>Contribute to more Open Source Software</li>
	<li>Release more software</li>
	<li>Become more successful than previous years</li>
	<li>Blog more than I ever have</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these are very doable, however, I&#39;m the one that&#39;s in the way of not succeeding. I really do hope that 2020 is my year to finally succeed in things that are important to me. Now let&#39;s talk about each resolution.</p>

<h2>Release a video game</h2>

<p>For the past few years, I&#39;ve been working on games on and off. Whether that be an actual project, a UE4 framework, or a game engine that I started last year. My cycle of life is I enjoy it for months on months and then I decide to move out of game dev and do something else. Recently I started working on some projects with a close friend to release for sale on the UE4 marketplace and Gumroad. We&#39;ve been successful at completing these products and listing them for sale. This has certainly helped build my confidence in releasing things (as I don&#39;t really release much stuff).</p>

<p>This year I hope to finally release a full game or at the very least have a full game project in the works. After all, this does generally take money to succeed and I&#39;m certainly not rich.</p>

<h2>Maybe join the military</h2>

<p>Every since I was a kid I remember playing army as do most kids and being fascinated with the military. A couple of years ago I was going to join the Air Force and then I didn&#39;t. I said to myself last summer (when I left game dev for the 1 millionth time) that I wanted to join the US Army and then when I got out to become a police officer or even a game warden. While I love the idea of being a LEO and a soldier, I think I love programming more. After all, we&#39;ll have to see how this year pans out. I mean I do really love my day job currently so who knows if I even will still do programming or have an interest in military/law enforcement.</p>

<h2>Lose some weight, ~30lbs</h2>

<p>For as long as I can remember I&#39;ve always been larger than my peers. Now as an adult I&#39;m not very bit (~220lbs @ ~5&#39; 7&quot;), however, I am overweight. This year I want to take control and lose some weight. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible to lose 30lbs and I know I can do it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Contribute to more Open Source Software</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve always had an interest in contributing to projects that are listed on GitHub and I&#39;ve never really done it. Sure, I&#39;ve sent some PR&#39;s doing simple things and nothing truly meaningful. This year I plan to change that. I think the reason why I&#39;ve never contributed to many projects is that I think we as programmers judge others code way too much. For example, I cringe when I see code that I wrote several years ago because I&#39;ve improved since. I think this is why I&#39;ve never really contributed to many projects because I don&#39;t want to be judged or called out for something.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Release more software</h2>

<p>This year I want to release more software whether it be paid or free. I didn&#39;t really write much software last year publicly and this year I would like to change that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Become more successful than previous years</h2>

<p>Pretty much every year I get more successful than the previous year. Sure I&#39;ve had a fair share of bad times, but this year I want to be better than any year before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Blog more than I ever have</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve always had some sort of blog and it usually goes down or I kill it. I&#39;d really like to keep a blog alive to have a showing of my writings that I&#39;ve done over the years. This year I plan to write more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until next time</p>
