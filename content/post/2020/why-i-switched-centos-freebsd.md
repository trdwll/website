<p>Simply put... software versions. I got tired of messing with compiling Python from source and all of that shit. I feel like FreeBSD is also faster when doing updates etc.</p>

<p>I used CentOS as my main OS for servers for several years and it pains me to say, but I love FreeBSD and I wish I made the switch a while back. I don&#39;t hate CentOS, but it&#39;s not going to be the OS that I choose when deploying stuff (unless I don&#39;t have a choice or I can&#39;t choose FreeBSD).</p>

<p>PS: Yes, this could&#39;ve just been a tweet. I don&#39;t care though. ðŸ˜‹</p>
