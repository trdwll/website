<p>Well it's been a while since I've done one of these so I think it's time to start again.</p>
<p>This week I've been implementing <a href="https://vivox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivox</a> again in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801550/Shifted_VR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shifted</a>. This time I've been putting it into C++ and I also used the actual SDK instead of a third party plugin from before. I've made some great progress on this recently and I'm about finished with it. I'll be moving onto some other tasks after this one so maybe next week I'll be writing about them some.</p>
<p>After I finish Vivox, I plan on writing up a short guide on implementing it into your project.</p>
<p>until next time</p>
