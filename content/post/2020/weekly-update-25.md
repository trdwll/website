<p>So this week I worked on setting up Linux dedicated server for Shifted. We had this working for a while, but as development progressed it eventually broke. I kept running into some issues with compiling (had to do with plugins and some other small things). I plan on writing a guide on doing Linux dedicated server eventually since my <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/setting-ue4-project-dedicated-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> about dedicated server was targeted for Windows.</p>
<p>I started writing the foundation for a few more guides that will be releasing early next year. I'm really excited about these next set of guides.&nbsp; I plan to work more on SteamBridge next week since I haven't messed with it in about a week.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
