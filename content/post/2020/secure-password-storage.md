<p>Once upon a time, I used a text document with all of my passwords and I stored this on a USB flashdrive. Before you ask - no I didn&#39;t keep it plugged in.</p>

<p>For several years now I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://keepass.info/" target="_blank">KeePass</a> and <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html" target="_blank">VeraCrypt</a>. I have a flash drive that I used VeraCrypt on and I store KeePass on it. I only mount my flash drive when I actually need a password or an ssh key etc. I don&#39;t keep it decrypted either - once I&#39;m finished I encrypt/unmount it.</p>

<p>There are a ton of password managers so choose wisely. Look up if they have vulnerabilities etc.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
