<p>Depending on what the screenshot is for will determine how I take the screenshot. If I&#39;m sharing the screenshot via Discord etc then I&#39;ll just use <a href="https://vgy.me" target="_blank">vgy.me</a> by using <a href="https://getsharex.com/" target="_blank">ShareX</a>. If I&#39;m sharing via this site then I&#39;ll just use the snipping tool that&#39;s built into windows.</p>

<p>A note on ShareX, it&#39;s crazy bloated with tools that shouldn&#39;t be in the application - but it works just fine. In fact, I built a tool a few years ago called <a href="https://trdwll.com/experiments/capturethat/" target="_blank">CaptureThat</a> (I doubt it still works lol), because ShareX is just bloated with stuff that I didn&#39;t use. One great thing about ShareX is it supports a TON of sites to upload your screenshot to and it also supports recording video.</p>
