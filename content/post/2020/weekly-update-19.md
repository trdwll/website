<p>Welp time to get back into the groove of writing these things. <em>(I hope)</em></p>
<p>So this week I've been very busy doing stuff with Steam and doing a major refactor to the project. I even got around to setting up the VR machine (my old desktop) so I can properly test <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801550/Shifted_VR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shifted</a> now. I believe we're going to have some exciting news in the coming weeks, but not 100% sure just yet. I'm really excited to get this game out the door and into the hands of players.</p>
<p>This weekend I plan to continue to refactor stuff and document our codebase as we've been neglecting that for a while. Who knows, I might end up working on something else. I'll let you know about it next Friday. ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>I playtested <a href="https://playdeadmatter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Matter</a> this week and unfortunately, I can't talk about it, but all I will say is it has HUGE potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also decided to start a <a href="https://github.com/incubatorlab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Org</a> and a <a href="https://incubator.onl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team</a> if you will. A team to develop open-source things for well... game development. I have some ideas for a couple of projects we're going to do so I look forward to talking about them in the future. (I'm just so damn busy with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801550/Shifted_VR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shifted</a> atm.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
