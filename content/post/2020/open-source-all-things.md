<p>After reading Tom Preston-Werner&#39;s post (<a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html" target="_blank">Open Source (Almost) Everything</a>) it got me thinking that I should write about this topic also.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a huge fan of open-source software. I know I haven&#39;t released a ton of software or even contributed to much, but it was a <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/new-years-resolutions-2020/" target="_blank">new years resolution</a> this year to do both of those things. I agree with open-sourcing most of your software as a company, but not your bread and butter.</p>

<h3>Regrets</h3>

<p>I wish I would&#39;ve open-sourced imglnx when I was running it. That would&#39;ve helped with advertising, security, and feature implementation. It could&#39;ve also allowed things to be implemented much quicker.</p>

<h3>What to open source</h3>

<p>Honestly everything other than the main software that your company sells. Do you have some libraries or any other code that&#39;s not the core application? If so, open-source them. This can help build trust with your community and again can help with security and features.</p>

<h3>fin</h3>

<p>So this year I plan to release more software and contribute to other software.</p>

<p>Honestly, my post is shit compared to Tom&#39;s - I don&#39;t even know why I wrote this post. <a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html" target="_blank">Go check it out</a>. ðŸ˜‹</p>

<p>until next time</p>
