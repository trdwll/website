<p>So <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation#Examples" target="_blank">Hungarian Notation</a> is an old(er) formatting for code. I don&#39;t fully use it, but I mainly use m_ for members so I know if they&#39;re a member of said class and s_ so I know the member is static.</p>

<p>A lot of people disagree with this formatting, but I use it just for cleanliness. Honestly, I don&#39;t really have another reason for this, it&#39;s just what I like. I like being able to read code and know where a member is from.</p>

<p>simply put, because</p>
