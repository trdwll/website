<p>I&#39;ve been writing code for 10 years - I started in 2009/2010. The first language that I picked up with Visual Basic and then about 2 weeks later I switched to C# as I liked the syntax of C# more. I then eventually moved into PHP, C++, and other languages. Over these years I&#39;ve worked on a ton of software - most private, but I&#39;ve still grown my skills over time.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m not the best engineer I certainly have things to learn and I&#39;m well aware of that. However, I do know I&#39;m a good engineer. I also sometimes feel that my knowledge and experience isn&#39;t enough and that does push me away from applying from some jobs.</p>

<h3>Determining If You Suffer From Imposter Syndrome</h3>

<p>I&#39;m no specialist, but if you know a good amount of stuff on your field and you feel like a fraud then you probably suffer from imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome is a psychological pattern in which one doubts one&#39;s accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a &quot;fraud&quot;.</p>

<h3>Moving on</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t really suffer from it as much as I used to, but I still have my days. If you think you suffer from it just know you&#39;re not alone. Go speak with a friend in the same field about your thoughts. It helped me when a friend told me that I was an excellent engineer. Just some simple words can help put imposter syndrome in its place. At least for me, it did.<em> (kinda)</em></p>
