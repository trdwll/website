<p>Over the past ~6 years I&#39;ve been friends with a great programmer - someone that has taught me stuff over the years and I still learn stuff from him. I&#39;ve grown to ask him for help when I&#39;m stuck rather than dig deep on an issue and this is certainly a <strong>BAD</strong> thing to do. I&#39;ve recently realized that I do it too often and while I still do my own research it&#39;s still bad. If I ever want to grow my skills I need to figure things out on my own - I&#39;m basically spoiled. I&#39;m certainly a better programmer than when I first started, but I can&#39;t stop thinking that maybe if I didn&#39;t ask for help as often my skills would be better.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not bad to ask for help, which I think most programmers are shy about or have a huge ego. If you&#39;re having trouble after trying to figure it out for several hours then yeah go ask for some help from someone.</p>

<p>Go and contribute to some open-source software. I&#39;ve noticed recently that as I&#39;ve been contributing to some software it&#39;s getting me out of my comfort zone and therefore I&#39;m learning new things. This will also get you some feedback on the code you write so then you can improve using that feedback. Imposter syndrome is a real thing...</p>
