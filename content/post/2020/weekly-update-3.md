<p>This week was crazy busy at my day job. We did aerification on Monday and the rest of the week was work revolving around that as it had rained etc.</p>
<p>Yesterday I test drove a truck that I'm currently looking at and I love it. We also cut down a couple of trees at work yesterday so that was fun. This week I haven't worked on Shifted or really anything else other than my day job stuff. Getting back into the groove of my day job is exhausting, but rewarding. Finally today, it was raining this morning so we didn't do much today at work. I mainly sanded rust off of some machinery to prep it for primer and paint.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
