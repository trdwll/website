<p>This week I finished up the major refactor of the GameMode and GameState. <em>Quick note, I used <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Resources/SampleGames/ShooterGame/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShooterGame</a> as a reference and it's working quite well for us.</em> I'll eventually do a post on something similar, but unfortunately, I can't just copy and paste the code from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801550/Shifted_VR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shifted</a>.</p>
<p>I somewhat handed off GM work to coworkers so I haven't touched anymore of it since. Instead, I've been working on getting dedicated servers working with Steam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't really do anything exciting this week and I doubt next week will be any better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
