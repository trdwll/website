<p>So the past few weekly updates I&#39;ve posted that I haven&#39;t done anything and that&#39;s 100% true. In fact, I skipped last week&#39;s weekly update since I didn&#39;t do anything last week either and I felt it was pointless to post that the same thing again.</p>

<p>Over the past month, I&#39;ve been so lazy that I haven&#39;t even written any code. I opened Beanstalk, read through some code, and closed Visual Studio. I lost all motivation last month and I&#39;m planning on working on an existing contract starting Monday (July 6, 2020) which will be a good amount of C++ that I&#39;ll get to write. I&#39;m going to write up a weekly update this week, but it might not be on Friday.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
