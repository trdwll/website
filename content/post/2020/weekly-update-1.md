<p>Since one of my <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/new-years-resolutions-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new year's resolutions</a> was to blog more (which I have already beat lol) I figured why not write an update post every week on what I did that week. I got the idea from <a href="https://troyhunt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt</a> except I'm not doing a video. Yes, I'm aware the week starts on Sundays, but I'm writing these posts every Friday so deal with it.</p>
<p>So what did I do this week? Well, I wasn't crazy productive this week, but here we go.</p>
<p>I contributed some to <a href="https://github.com/trdwll/TRDWLL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TRDWLL</a> which is this website and added Vivox in Shifted (a VR project I'm contracted on right now). I published some posts this week also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also got some good news today, I'm going back to my day job March 10th, 2020 - I'm excited. I know this isn't the best post, but I'll improve with time as you do with anything.</p>
<p>until next time</p>
