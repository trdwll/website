<p>This week I really only worked on <a href="https://github.com/trdwll/steambridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamBridge</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trdwll/VSDiscordRP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSDiscordRP</a>. I've played Jurassic World: Evolution and some Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint also. Both are great games btw.</p>
<p>It also snowed for the first time this year a few days ago. We didn't get much and it didn't even cover the roads, but we have snow. ðŸ˜€ Next week I plan to work more on SteamBridge and get it more ready for production. I did start thinking about doing async stuff so if I end up doing that then it's going to require a refactor of a good amount of stuff. Hopefully, it won't be that bad, but we'll see. The <a href="https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facepunch.Steamworks</a> is fully async so it would be nice to do it for UE4 also.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
