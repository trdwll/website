<p>Over the weekend I decided to open source an inventory system that I was working on a while back. It's available <a href="https://trdwll.com/experiments/inventory-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Instead of telling you what I did every single day of the week at my day job which tbh is getting annoying to try and remember what I did - I'm going to just write larger events that go on at my day job.</p>
<p>This week we mainly worked on cutting and laying sod on a new teebox.</p>

<p>We still have to lay sod for the rough around the teebox so that should be very soon.</p>
<p>I also moved some of my major projects like <a href="https://trdwll.com/experiments/beanstalk-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beanstalk Engine</a> into their own organization on GitHub. I recreated the organization and repo for <a href="https://trdwll.com/experiments/corkbb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CorkBB</a> so I do plan on working on that eventually.</p>
<p>I do however have some great news, well for myself that is. I started intermittent fasting on the 19th of April and I can say that I'm proud of myself. I just need to stick to it for a few months and I should drop some weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
