<p>It&#39;s been a few weeks since my last weekly update and it&#39;s for a good reason. The past few weeks I&#39;ve been very busy working on Shifted. We&#39;re currently preparing the game to show to various investors so everything needs to be perfect. My work should continue to be crazy for the next few weeks and then it <em>should</em> slow down some. Hopefully, we&#39;ll have something to share with the public very soon.</p>
