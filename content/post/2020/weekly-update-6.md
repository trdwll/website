<p>This week wasn't that eventful. I ran a weedeater all week at my day job, but today I learned something new. I got to run a collar mower for the first time and it was pretty easy. I'm glad that I'm learning new things at my day job.</p>
<p>Over last weekend I pushed some updates to HordeMode which was very exciting. I plan to work on it more this weekend, but we'll see.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
