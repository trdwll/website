<p>This week went by really fast - then again my sleep schedule is really screwed up right now. I'm on NZ hours. ðŸ˜žI really just relaxed this week and played games. A couple of friends and I played and beat Dying Light with all DLC in about 30 hours across 3 days.</p>
<p>I worked on <a href="https://github.com/trdwll/steambridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamBridge</a> a little bit and finished up Linux support (dedicated server) for Shifted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
