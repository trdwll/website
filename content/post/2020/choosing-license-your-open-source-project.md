<p>There are soo many licenses for open source projects and it can be confusing to choose which one you should go with. There&#39;s 2 sites that I use when deciding on a license or if I just want to read about said license - <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/" target="_blank">tldrlegal</a> and <a href="https://choosealicense.com/" target="_blank">choosealicense</a>.</p>

<p>I usually choose either <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license" target="_blank">MIT</a> or <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-(revised)" target="_blank">BSD 3-clause</a> for most of my projects. Both of these licenses allow the end-user or anyone to do whatever they want with the code as long as they provide attribution.</p>

<p>I originally planned for this post to be long and explain certain licenses, but I&#39;m not an attorney and I only use a couple of licenses anyway so there&#39;s no point.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
