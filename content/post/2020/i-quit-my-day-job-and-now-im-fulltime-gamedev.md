<p>Over the past few months, I&#39;ve started hating the golf course job more and more - to the point that I would call off and not care about the repercussions. I&#39;m happy to say that I left that job as of Sunday, August 23, 2020. The job was amazing in the beginning, but as time passed I slowly started to dislike it. This job laid off staff during the winter (since you can&#39;t exactly mow grass in the cold (you actually can lol)). I&#39;ve always known that I didn&#39;t want to have a long career in golf course maintenance so here I am. My body can&#39;t take 90*F+ with humidity or standing/walking for hours any longer. My feet are always killing me and coming home with migraines from the heat isn&#39;t fun either. The job is great, but not for everyone and my time was always limited from day one.</p>

<p>I learned so much at the course and I&#39;ll always be thankful that I was able to learn as much as I was able to. This job certainly helped me socially (I&#39;ve struggled with social situations for a long time - I&#39;m just very awkward, but not as much anymore.) - it helped me come out of my &quot;shell&quot; more. This job also has no advancement for a guy like me - what I mean is I&#39;ll never become a manager/supervisor etc. So thank you Andy for giving me a chance at a job that I&#39;ve never done before.</p>

<p>I received a job offer for The Revera Corporation (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801550/Shifted_VR/" target="_blank">Shifted VR</a>) and I decided to take it. I not only make more money doing it, but I also get more development experience to help push my dev career, and I also get to work from home. So thank you to Albert for offering me the job. I certainly do appreciate it.</p>

<p>Word of advice, if you&#39;re getting burnt out and depressed with your job then maybe you should start looking elsewhere for a new job. That&#39;s just my 2 cents on this.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s to the jobs that we dislike and continue to do, because of finances. Don&#39;t worry, things will get better eventually so just hang in there. We&#39;ve all been through it.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
