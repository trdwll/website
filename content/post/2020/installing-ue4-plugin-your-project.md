<p>This is a very easy thing to do so don't worry.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the plugin is downloaded from the Marketplace then go into your Engine install directory (mine is <strong>C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.24\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace</strong>). If it's download elsewhere then just go to step 2.</li>
<li>Copy the plugin folder that you're wanting to add to your project into your project/Plugins directory</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's literally all that you need to do. Just open your project and done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
