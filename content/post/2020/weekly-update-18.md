<p>I've been failing to write one of these for a while so I figured I'd go ahead and write one this week.</p>
<p>For the past few weeks I've been working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801550/Shifted_VR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shifted VR</a> more and I'm really happy with the work. I can't go into exact details on stuff that I've been working on other than I reimplemented Vivox in C++, implemented Steam Parties, and a Dynamic Spawning System.</p>
<p>I have some really exciting news coming very soon so get ready for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
