<p>When developing a website one main concern should be is performance. Here are a few tools to help you debug what could be causing speed issues. <em>(load times)</em></p>

</ul>
<p>These sites are basically the same thing, but it's always a good idea to use different references when debugging.</p>
<p>Using these sites I was able to speed up this site by a good amount. At the time of writing this I could still strip out some of my css from bootstrap that it's being used, but I think it's ok enough.</p>
