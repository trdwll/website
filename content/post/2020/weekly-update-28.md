<p>This week was another week of work on SteamBridge and being lazy. Maybe next week I'll have some tasks on Shifted.</p>
<p>I did manage to add 8 classes in SteamBridge since last week and the plugin is almost finished. I just need to lay down the foundation for async methods so I can then add the methods that I've skipped. Once that's finished I'll move on to the Web portion of the plugin and once I'm finished with SteamBridge I can move onto EOSBridge.</p>
<p>I also got a new contract for the short-term since I haven't really worked on Shifted for a while. I'm now working on a <a href="https://midjungard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a> called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202410/Midjungard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midjungard</a>. I'm currently contracted for the implementation of Steam microtransactions, storing player data (such as stats) using DynamoDB, and adding Linux support for their dedicated servers. More on this next week as I complete those tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
