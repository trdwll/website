<p>I began writing code back in early 2010. I got into programming so I could make mods for a game that you may have heard of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Sure mods ruined that game and several others, but it not only helped teach me code - it also gave me an outlet as a teenager. Instead of being out doing mischievous things I would stay inside and write code. This code from back then wasn&#39;t good at all, but it was fun.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily regret making mods or as they&#39;re now known as cheats, but I do regret using them to gain an advantage over other players and ruining their experience. However, my time making mods taught me code and some small reverse engineering. After a couple of years writing mods I &quot;retired&quot; and moved on to other things.</p>

<p>I remember taking a break from modding and then after a year or so a new method of modding came out and it was called RTM/RTE (real-time modding/editing) which was just editing memory. This was a cool time because we could use C# or C++ to develop applications using the CCAPI (there was another API that I can&#39;t remember atm). I hadn&#39;t released any software for this type of modding, but I ended up working on a cool tool similar to what <a href="https://jmswrnr.com" target="_blank">James Warner</a> (uTor Engine - linked below) had been working on - except my tool was going to support multiple games only for PS3. I lost this software by accident due to reinstalling my OS.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I only got into programming, because I saw someone else having some mods and I wanted to learn how to do it also. If you&#39;re wanting to get into programming this is the wrong way to go about it. You should figure out what you want to do with code and then learn the best language for that task.</p>

<p>All of this was done under an alias so I can&#39;t exactly show the work I did back then on my portfolio. lol</p>
