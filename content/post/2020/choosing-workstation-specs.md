<p><strong>An updated version of my workstation is listed on this <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/new-house-new-office-and-new-workstation/" target="_blank">post</a>. </strong></p>

<p>I used to get asked often about pc specs for various things and I&#39;ve spec&#39;d out some systems for some friends over the years. Recently I was speaking with someone on Discord and I asked what they think that I should write about on my blog - you know useful stuff. So here&#39;s one idea from them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When building a workstation or a pc the first thing you need to figure out is what you&#39;re going to be doing with it specifically. This is an important thing to think about because it could save you some money and even a headache down the line.</p>

<p>For anything that&#39;s resource-intensive such as rendering or compiling code I&#39;d recommend getting as much ram and cores that you can. Remember you don&#39;t need to spend thousands of dollars to get a good system anymore, you could get an older i7 and still do great work with it.</p>

<p>For gaming... go with something clocked high with a good amount of cores and get a good gpu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly go to <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/builds/">PCPartPicker</a> build page and use the slider on the left for a price that you&#39;re targetting. You&#39;ll get an idea of systems that you can build around your price.</p>

<p>You could even go to craigslist etc and find some good secondhand components. <strong>Regardless of what you choose as a system, make sure you get an SSD.</strong></p>

<h3>My current system/specs/setup</h3>

<p>I have a very nice system, but it&#39;s not the best in terms of the price. For example, I could&#39;ve waited a year or two and got the components cheaper than I did at the time. (some were bought around tax time in the US a few years ago so I overpaid for stuff like ram)</p>

<p><a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/trdwll/saved/NVJzMp">https://pcpartpicker.com/user/trdwll/saved/NVJzMp</a>&nbsp;is my current setup and I do plan to upgrade this year. <em>(maybe)</em> I also OC to 4.7GHz .</p>

<p>I also used to run a homelab so I&#39;d offload stuff onto it, but since I stopped using it I needed a more powerful system which is what I linked above.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a system that I threw together that I&#39;m considering upgrading to, but again I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to as my current one is just fine. <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/trdwll/saved/LHXXvK">https://pcpartpicker.com/user/trdwll/saved/LHXXvK</a></p>
