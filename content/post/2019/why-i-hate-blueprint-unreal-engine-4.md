<p>Hate isn't the best word to describe my feelings towards Blueprint ("BP"). Let's go ahead and change that to strongly dislike or just dislike.</p>
<p>So I dislike using BP for a few reasons and the main one is performance. Yes, I'm aware you can use nativization to speed it up, but C++ would still be faster in the long run. I'm a programmer, I don't feel like a programmer when I write BP and I find networking easier in C++. I also find C++ much cleaner and easier to understand <em>(even if the code isn't documented)</em>. I guess that's like most programmers, we find code easy to understand. /shrug</p>
<p>Also this <a href="https://blueprintsfromhell.tumblr.com/">https://blueprintsfromhell.tumblr.com/</a> is why BP is bad imo.</p>
<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>I use BP for UI, AI, and some other things like simple prototyping; then I port it to C++. I don't think I'll ever stop using BP fully as it's kind of a necessity with Unreal Engine 4 ("UE4").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
