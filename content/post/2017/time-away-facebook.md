<p>So I deleted my Facebook account about a month ago. In the past, I had deleted it multiple times, but I&rsquo;ve always come back to the site. This is probably the longest I&rsquo;ve gone without actually activating it again and I&rsquo;d like to talk about it.</p>
<h3>Why did I delete my account?</h3>
<p>Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t use it much and when I did it was to only get a few friends to join Teamspeak or Discord, etc. So there wasn&rsquo;t any real point in even keeping it. I don&rsquo;t like the platform (more on this later) and I don&rsquo;t like reading people's bitching about whatever. (even though I read some cancerous shit on Twitter, it&rsquo;s not as bad as Facebook imo.) What do you mean the platform is bad? Hold your horses, my dude, I&rsquo;ll get to it <em>soon</em>.</p>
<p>I rarely post on Twitter or even this blog so there&rsquo;s no point in having another social media account that for one I don&rsquo;t like and two a place to keep updated. Now, let me explain why I think Facebook is bad.</p>
<h3>Facebook is bad</h3>
<p>So you held your horses for a minute and now I get to reveal why I think Facebook is bad. My time on Facebook wasn&rsquo;t really pleasant for the reasons below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super laggy (I believe it&rsquo;s all of the fucking js they run)</li>
<li>People always put their opinion out there looking to start an argument</li>
<li>Game invites</li>
<li>People feel it&rsquo;s necessary to tell their friends what they&rsquo;re doing 24/7 <em>(like any of us really give a fuck)</em> orrrrr they post a ton of memes, lyrics, or other stupid shit</li>
<li>Facebook is full of bullshit like sidebars, ads, video streaming, etc&hellip;&hellip;. just stuff they shouldn&rsquo;t have imo</li>
<li>Drama&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h3>What now?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my time away from Facebook, it&rsquo;s like taking some time off of work to just get away &ndash; in fact it&rsquo;s exactly like a vacation. I do randomly activate it for a minute just to ping a friend or whatever, but I don&rsquo;t keep it for long. I really think it&rsquo;s &lsquo;healthier' to stay away from Facebook (at least for me), but idk.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve purged myself from Facebook the next site will be all Google products as I said a while back in another <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/too-many-email-addresses/">post</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
