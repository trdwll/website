<p>Since I said I&rsquo;d write more I thought about this and now here I am writing about it.</p>
<p>Recently I started paying for <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repositories so I can have private repositories. Now, why would I pay for private repositories when I can host <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a> on either my home lab or a cheap VPS? It&rsquo;s mostly GitHub having backups like if my home lab were to go offline I could lose data, or even on a VPS I could forget about the payment and lose all of my data. Honestly, for $7 /m for unlimited private repositories &ndash; you can&rsquo;t beat that. So now the question comes in, why didn&rsquo;t I just use <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitBucket</a>? Well, I do use BitBucket for old projects that I don&rsquo;t want to merge to GitHub. I prefer to keep all of my code in one place rather than 2 or 3.</p>
<p>So it really comes down to the easy way vs having to manage a server vs code in multiple places.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
