<p>It&rsquo;s been a bit since I&rsquo;ve written here or rather anywhere for that matter. I&rsquo;ve recently started to save money to get some certifications or at least go and take the exams so I can get certified. The first certification I&rsquo;m going to take is <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/offensive-security-wireless-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Offensive Security Wireless Professional</a>. I&rsquo;m going with this cert first as wireless is a thing I&rsquo;m not too familiar with compared to web security <em>(I&rsquo;m far from being an expert)</em> and wireless is an easy way to gain access to said company or whatever &ndash; I&rsquo;d like to know how to secure wireless networks better than I currently do. The next certification I&rsquo;d like to go for is <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Offensive Security Certified Professional</a> and then some others like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osce-offensive-security-certified-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Offensive Security Certified Expert</a>, CompTIA&rsquo;s <a href="https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A+</a>, <a href="https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network+</a>, and <a href="https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security+</a>.</p>
<p>If all goes well I&rsquo;ll be certified in a few things within this year or even sooner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
