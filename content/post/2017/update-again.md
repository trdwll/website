<p>So I guess I only want to write the 3rd of every month (previous posts are written on the 3rd). I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why that is, but whatever. I&rsquo;d like to actually put this site to use as I did pay for a year, but things get in the way throughout the month.</p>
<p>I recently decided to rewrite <a href="https://github.com/trdwll/CaptureThat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CaptureThat</a> since it is one of the projects I&rsquo;m very proud of. Well, why would I want to rewrite it? Well, when I first wrote CaptureThat, it was poorly written, depended on apollo (a library I wrote), and just wasn&rsquo;t well optimized. My plan is completely to rebuild it from the ground up, not use dependencies, cleaner code, and make sure it supports more sites. In the first version, I focused on the UI/style of the application, you know &ndash; aesthetics &ndash; stuff that doesn&rsquo;t matter (at least to a programmer).</p>
<p>I also bought <a href="https://xenforo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XenForo</a> so I could make a community and also some XenForo plugins to sell/release. Why did I choose XenForo? Well, to simply put it XenForo is one of the most secure forum software there are with the exception of <a href="https://vbulletin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vBulletin</a> (<em>jokes</em>). In all seriousness, from my experiences with XenForo, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s very secure. You can even take a look at the <a href="https://xenforo.com/community/forums/announcements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XenForo Community Forums</a> to see the vulns that are patched in updates &ndash; it&rsquo;s not much or very critical vulns.</p>
<p>So what am I doing now? Well, other than CaptureThat and my community &ndash; nothing except work. I do plan to write more to make this blog more useful or rather entertaining. I really want to start posting some research or mini-tutorials here as I planned when I first started this site. Who knows what the future entails.</p>
<p>until next time</p>
