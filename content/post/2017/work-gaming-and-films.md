<p>Time flies by when you&rsquo;re working, gaming, and watching films. Over the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve been working Monday-Friday (more hours than usual), gaming (Rust, 911: First Responders, The Forest, and Cities: Skylines), I&rsquo;ve also been watching Criminal Minds (all seasons), Rescue Me (all seasons), Chicago Fire/PD/Med, Hawaii Five-0, and various films. All of these things take up a lot of time especially when you&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about getting ARK: Survival Evolved, Miscreated, Subnautica, and Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 (which I&rsquo;m going to need a new GPU for SGW3 :D). However, if I get any more games that&rsquo;s only going to take up more of my time. I&rsquo;ve always loved gaming and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever fully stop. I tend to get burnt out of it after a ~month, but I still continue to game.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
