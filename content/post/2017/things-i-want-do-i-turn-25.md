<p><strong>Update: April 26, 2021.</strong> I imported this post from my old WordPress blog and I'm now 25 (almost 26) so I'll respond to these. I've accomplished 1 of these which is 7. Looking back I'm not sure why I wanted to do these things. They wouldn't actually change my life. I guess I needed filler content. lol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turn 22 next week. Yeah. 22. I know. I&rsquo;m old.</p>
<p>Anyway, recently I&rsquo;ve started thinking about things I&rsquo;d like to do before I turn 25. These things aren&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s going to cost millions or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. They&rsquo;ll actually cost significantly less than buying a new 2017 Suburban. All jokes aside, I&rsquo;ll just list them below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Scuba Diving (PADI certified) so I can dive wherever and whenever :p</li>
<li>Visit a few places out of the US such as Sweden, UK, Japan, Australia, and possibly even New Zealand</li>
<li>Visit some places in the US like Texas, California, Colorado, Florida, and New York</li>
<li>Visit Google, Apple, Discord, Microsoft, Facebook, NASA, and perhaps even GitHub</li>
<li>Meet more famous people? Not that I think it&rsquo;d make me any better than anyone, but I think it&rsquo;d be cool to meet a few more famous people.</li>
<li>Get out and get so shit-faced I end up <a href="https://youtu.be/fWddGm-hz2c?t=50s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waking up in the middle of a cornfield naked with a dead deer nearby.</a> <em>(just kidding about the cornfield and dead deer, but serious about the shit faced part)</em></li>
<li>Get my dream job</li>
<li>Possibly move out of the US or just out of Kentucky at least</li>
</ol>
<p>until next time</p>
