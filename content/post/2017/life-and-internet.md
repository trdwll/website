<p>The last <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/work-gaming-and-films/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> I wrote was about life. How I&rsquo;m busy more than ever and where my time is going. I know these posts are probably the most boring, but I&rsquo;d like to look back in time and see what I was doing with my life. Like remembering a loved one when they pass &ndash; all of the good times.</p>
<p>So work is still a thing, 5 days a week and even more hours than the last post. I&rsquo;ve been doing some gaming (Arma 3, Fallout 4, Rust, American Truck Simulator, and some Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Ghost Recon Wildlands). On my time off I&rsquo;ve almost completed Criminal Minds (or at least caught up) and some small amounts of programming.</p>
<p>I have some great news, I bought a GTX 1070 so now I&rsquo;m able to run pretty much any game on the market at a reasonable fps. I pre-ordered SGW3 and I can&rsquo;t wait until it releases.</p>
<p>In other news, I met someone. I quickly found out that we are not compatible as we are completely different so I guess we&rsquo;ll continue to be friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now to the second part of this post. My ISP recently upgraded my bandwidth to 1TB /m. I&rsquo;m completely fine with that. ðŸ˜‚ I&rsquo;ve also got 200Mbps/15Mbps instead of my old 100Mbps/10Mbps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
