<p>I have way too many email addresses. I&rsquo;m always making a new email account somewhere for something. I tend to use <a href="https://gmail.com">gmail </a>or self-hosted as they&rsquo;re the quickest to create. I just went through my list of emails and I have 6 <a href="https://gmail.com">gmail </a> and 8 self-hosted (some I&rsquo;m not including as I don&rsquo;t use them often &ndash;&nbsp; like webmaster@domain.tld).</p>
<p>So I have an addiction. lol. I believe it&rsquo;s a good addiction, but a very annoying one. I usually use an email for 1-5 things (like registrations) and then move to another, I mix my web accounts between 5-10 emails. By not using the same email everywhere it makes it more difficult to target the user, the same with passwords. I really need to stop making new email addresses.</p>
<p>I recently started thinking about leaving <a href="https://gmail.com">gmail</a> and other providers to do self-hosted fully, a better solution like <a href="https://riseup.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">riseup</a> or something similar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably questioning why I&rsquo;m thinking about leaving <a href="https://gmail.com">gmail</a>, well the <a href="https://xo.tc/good-bye-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> from <a href="https://xo.tc/pages/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Van Delft</a> and other resources have got me thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
