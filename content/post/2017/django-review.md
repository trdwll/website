<p>Now that <a href="https://imglnx.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imglnx</a> is released I can finally &lsquo;review&rsquo; <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Django</a>. I love it. I love Django more than I do PHP. (holy crap, I actually said that?!!?) It has everything already built-in and if it doesn&rsquo;t have something you need, you can import it via pip.</p>
<p>So why did I choose Django for imglnx? Well to be honest I worked with a team that kept pushing me to learn it and I can see why now. I also was craving the feel of learning something new and PHP was a bit old for me. In Django, I feel like you make something work with less code and in PHP you have to write more. idk. Django also protects against <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various vulnerabilities</a> out-of-the-box and they take the security of the framework very seriously.</p>
<p>A friend of mine kept asking me to learn <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NodeJS</a> or <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails</a>. I said no to both. lol. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to relearn <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a> for a while and Django has allowed me to do that. I really enjoyed Python when I last wrote it (years ago) and I&rsquo;m really enjoying it now. I&rsquo;m going to start recommending it to friends over PHP.</p>
<p>When in doubt choose Django over PHP. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
