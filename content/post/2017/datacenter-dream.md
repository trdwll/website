<p>or the past few years I&rsquo;ve had the dream to start my own data center. Not a small one, but something that I&rsquo;d need a good chunk of change to start. (I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;good luck Russ&rdquo;) Anyway, ever since I saw that <a href="http://www.ironmountain.com/Services/Data-Centers/Locations/Pennsylvania-Data-Center.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iron Mountain</a> has a data center in an actual mountain it has made me want to do the same. I just think it&rsquo;s the coolest thing ever.</p>
<p>While this idea isn&rsquo;t realistic since land is quite expensive, I&rsquo;ve looked around and found some property in my area. (I&rsquo;ve always had an interest in land development/architecture, but math isn&rsquo;t my friend.) I found a rather nice field in the middle of the city near me that&rsquo;s been for sale for at least 10 years. I found out that the property is contaminated which is why it&rsquo;s for sale still.</p>
<p>Now with the property being contaminated it only pushes me back further with my dream. Even if the property wasn&rsquo;t contaminated, I&rsquo;d have to buy it, get permits, contractors, architects, etc&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; the list goes on and on. The property is the best place I&rsquo;ve found would be one hell of a data center lot. This data center wouldn&rsquo;t be (I estimate), but $20-$30 million. However, I could be completely wrong with the price.</p>
<p>I suppose I could build a data center with &lt; $100,000, but I don&rsquo;t even have that kind of money. &macr;\_(ãƒ„)_/&macr; Oh well.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll drop this dream and let the rich people handle the building of data centers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
