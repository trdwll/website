<p>The new job is going very well. I'm still working on a major feature that's being implemented in 5 phases. I'm currently on phase 2 - about to move into phase 3. ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://mattermost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mattermost</a> for our dev chat so I decided to use that for my company also. I went ahead and configured Mattermost for my company so when I'm ready to use it I can.</p>
<p>I'm currently taking a look at <a href="https://js.wiki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wiki JS</a> to be the internal wiki software for my company in the future. Originally I wanted to use GitHub wiki, but I don't want to pay for a Pro account for the organization. I plan to use the new <a href="https://github.com/features/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Issues</a> for the project management/bug tracking when it releases, but I might find something like Redmine to run.</p>
<p>I've been playing <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World</a> this week also. This is my first MMO and it's amazing. I'm really looking forward to the full release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
