<p>The last couple of weeks have been busy for me. I've been working on my project and I can say I've been making some good progress.</p>
<p>I found my old WordPress blog so I brought over some posts from 2016-2017. I had some others but decided against bringing them over. I'm also pretty sure I had a blog full of posts before 2016 as I had the first Hello World in 2015. Oh well. ü§∑&zwj;‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>Seeing old posts about security-related things makes me want to get back into security. I doubt I ever will as I really love working on games. üòÄ</p>
<p>I also added a small description to the titles of <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/category/weekly-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly updates</a>. I skipped some as nothing really had happened that week.</p>
<p>until next time</p>
