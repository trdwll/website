<p>Update: March 22, 2022: Yeah no fucking clue what happened to that inventory. I don't have it anymore...</p>

<p>It's been a busy few weeks for me. I've finally completed phase 5 on NMRiH2 and began working on phase 6.</p>
<p>I bought new monitors this week, so instead of using <a href="https://www.newegg.com/asus-vc239h-23-full-hd/p/N82E16824236583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6 24" 1080p 60Hz monitors</a>, I'm now using <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16824012015?Item=N82E16824012015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 27" 1440p 144Hz monitors</a>. The change is awesome and I wish I would've upgraded a long time ago. I also bought new studio monitors (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TY94WRX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mackie CR3-XBT</a>) with a sub (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083N6Q72Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mackie CR8S-XBT</a>). <em>Before you flip shit, I don't use bottled water anymore; I bought a water cooler and only use that bottle to fill it. </em>I ordered 2 16oz water bottles from Nalgene also - they should be in soon.</p>

<p>I began working on an inventory system <sub>(I know, I've built an inventory a few times already)</sub>, but this time it's like New World. More info on that soon.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
