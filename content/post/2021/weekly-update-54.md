<p>I worked hard on NMRiH2 over the past 2 weeks trying to finish up Phase 5. I've merged most of the functionality into main this week so that's awesome. I'm planning on having Phase 5 entirely completed and 1 pass polished by next Friday.</p>
<p>The initial design for my small hobby project is taking shape more. If the project actually becomes more than a document then I'll end up open-sourcing bits of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
