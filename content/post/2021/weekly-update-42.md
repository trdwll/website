<p>Over the last week, I've been working on adding the skill/talent system to my game. For the most part, it's finished - I just have to finish up the early UI for it. After I finish up the skills I'll likely be working on either more AI or I may work on the <a href="https://trdwll.com/experiments/udatabase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database</a> plugin as I'll start needing that soon. I don't know, we'll see what I end up working on next week. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>I bought a 3-year fishing license for my state on Tuesday so I'm planning to get back into fishing very soon.</p>
<p>I also set up Google Cloud Storage for backups, instead of paying for a VPS that was $3.99/m I'm now paying a few cents a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
