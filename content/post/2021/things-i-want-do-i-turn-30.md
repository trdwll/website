<p><a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/things-i-want-do-i-turn-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previously</a> I wrote about the same thing, but before 25. I only accomplished one of the things that I wanted to do so I think it's time to change that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turn 26 next week. üôÅ</p>
<ol>
<li>PADI certified - I've always wanted to scuba dive.</li>
<li>Own a good amount of land and some rental properties.</li>
<li>Have a successful company ($1mm/y+) that employs &gt;= 10 people. - I'd be ok with a successful company though.</li>
<li>Start a company to help indie game devs build games. - This backpacks on 3. as I would need money to make this happen.</li>
<li>Travel more, maybe to other states or countries. - I really don't get out much, in fact, I'm considered anti-social by family, and friends - but I'm not... I just don't care about going places much.</li>
<li>Allocate more time for family and friends. - I don't spend as much time as I should with them and I know I'll regret it when I'm older and they're dead. üò¢</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
