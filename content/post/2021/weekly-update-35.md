<p>This week I started work on the weapon system for my side project and it's coming along quite nicely. I played some Call of Duty: Cold War this week also as I have in the previous few weeks. I finished writing a guide for Steam also, but I'm waiting to publish it when I finish the async portion of SteamBridge as the guide doesn't work 100%. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
