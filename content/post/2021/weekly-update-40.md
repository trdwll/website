<p>This week I worked on porting my inventory system to use another method for storage and replication. I've started writing a guide on building an inventory system so that should be out in a couple of weeks. I've been working on my inventory for so long now and I've got it to the point that I'm very happy with it. Unfortunately, it's taken me a couple of months to get it just right.</p>
<p>I've also started designing some other features for my game. I can't wait until I have the stuff to show that I can share with everyone. I'm so excited. ðŸ˜€ This inventory rebuild has really put a damper on other feature implementation, but more features will be added soon.</p>
<p>until next time</p>
