<p>Well, it's certainly been over a week since the last update - sorry about that. I've been really busy working on NMRiH2 and I'm making good progress.&nbsp; I'm very close to entering phase 5 which I estimate will take a month to finish. Phase 4 has taken longer than I had expected, but I'm very close.</p>
<p>I decided this week that I wouldn't be working on SteamBridge or UDatabase for the time being as I don't have the time. I also announced in my discord that I wasn't going to be making EOSBridge as Epic is making its own plugin to implement EOS.</p>
<p>I finished my new desk/office this week also so more on that next week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
