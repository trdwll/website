<p>This week I worked the final hours on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202410/Midjungard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midjungard</a>. I also started working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801550/Shifted_VR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shifted</a> again after a month-ish. On Shifted I started working on Linux support again. Apparently, in the past month, it broke again. ðŸ¤·</p>
<p>I moved all of my media on the site to my google cloud storage bucket and now everything is being served from <code>files.trdwll.net</code> instead of <code>trdwll.com/media/</code>. This will allow faster speeds when downloading any media and it's cached very strictly.</p>
<p>On the release of SteamBridge on the Unreal Marketplace, it got a ton of acquires very quickly. If only I were charging just $4.99. ðŸ˜€</p>
