<p>Saturday was my last day on the VAIL VR team. This decision wasn't made lightly and it wasn't on bad terms. Albert and the VAIL team are amazing people, I wish VAIL and the team luck.</p>
<p>I also left the HodlGod team yesterday. Again not on bad terms, my contract was just up and I didn't want to go to full time. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Now am unemployed. lmao</p>
<p>I've been working on my side project quite a bit and as I've said last week I'm finishing up the inventory system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
