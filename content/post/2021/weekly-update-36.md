<p>So this is delayed by a week since I was hit by a major ice/snow storm which caused a power and internet outage at my house/office.</p>
<p>The storm really sucked. I had to go to a neighbors house and stay for a week while the power company resolved the outages around the county. Really all I did last week was watch movies and hang out with my neighbors. (in this case it was my dad lol)</p>
<p>I started designing and implementing the second version of my inventory system in my game. It's coming along quite nicely so we'll see how it actually turns out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
