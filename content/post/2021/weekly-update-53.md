<p>This week I was very busy on NMRiH2 so I didn't think about writing a post. I've mostly completed phase 5 so now I just have to go do a polish pass and it's finished. I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to be working on next, but I have been given some ideas as to what it'll be.</p>
<p>I'm still designing the smaller tycoon game so I'm getting pretty excited about that. Yes I know I've jumped to a few projects over the past couple of years, but tbh the ones that I've dropped have been way too big for me to do alone. Let's be honest here also, it's not like that time was really wasted as I learned stuff. ü§∑&zwj;‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>until next time</p>
