<p>Hey pal!</p>
<p>I started a new job working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_In_Hell_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No More Room in Hell 2</a> this Monday. I can't exactly talk about what I'm working on just yet, but when the game releases I'll be able to - it's some very exciting systems that I'm sure will bring a ton of fun to the game. I'm very excited to be working with industry veterans so I can learn more stuff.</p>
<p>I haven't worked on my game this week as I have a new job, but I plan to pick up development again very soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
