<p>Welp, it's been 2 weeks since a "weekly update".</p>
<p>I've been working on my game a ton more. I've almost finished the first pass of refactoring the weapon system. I plan to do a write-up about weapon systems and inventory systems in UE4/5 eventually when I have the free time.</p>
<p>I did a major refactor to the character class and separated it into multiple classes so my AI can use some of the cool features. I ripped out my day-night cycle system in favor of the Ultra Dynamic Sky plugin. I also finally fixed lootable actors (chests) as they've been broken for quite some time due to the major refactor of the inventory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
