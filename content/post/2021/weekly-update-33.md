<p>I worked on SteamBridge some this week. This work won't be pushed into a release for a while so don't get excited. ðŸ™‚ SteamBridge is also up to ~18.5k acquires. If only I charged $4.99. ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>I started working on the async portion of SteamBridge and since I don't fully understand it's going to take some time to get working.</p>
<p>My friends Brandon and Dar grouped up with me on Saturday and played some Cold War zombies until my pc froze at round 87 and ended it for us. ðŸ˜­</p>

<p>Our previous highest round was 61, but since I crashed and was host the new highest round didn't update. We'll get there again one day.</p>
<p>I even pushed some small updates to the website. I think the border around content looks much better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
