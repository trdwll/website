<p>Currently, in my office, I have 3 desktop machines. 1 <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/new-house-new-office-and-new-workstation/">main workstation</a> (the pc that I'm writing this from), 1 <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/new-server-new-network/">server</a>, and 1 old workstation (that I talk about some <a href="https://trdwll.com/blog/new-house-new-office-and-new-workstation/">here</a>). A couple of months ago I saw a <a href="https://www.thermaltakeusa.com/core-w200.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case</a> on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EGBZA1C/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> for $500 and ... I finally decided to buy it. ðŸ˜­ The decision to get this case wasn't exactly necessary (no shit), but I really wanted to put 2 machines in 1 case... I just wish it was cheaper.</p>
<p>I put my old workstation and new workstation in the case and well it's great. The fans in the case are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087DQK2G9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apevia TL612L2S-RGB Twilight</a> and I used 7 of <a href="https://www.newegg.com/rosewill-rocf-13001-case-fan/p/N82E16835200072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosewill 120mm Case Fan 4-Pack</a> <sub><em>(so I have 5 left)</em></sub>. The Apevia fans blow so much air and they're pretty quiet. The Rosewill fans I got on sale and I bought 3 packs of them. They're very quiet and this review sums it up. The reviews on both fans were pretty good at the time of my purchase. I purchased a fan controller to control some exhaust fans. The fan controller I chose was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B9618C2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermaltake Commander F6</a> and it's actually really nice - it serves its purpose.</p>

<p>I know the audio in the videos is a little loud (lol), but I have a box fan on and a server with loud fans. I promise my workstation is quiet. ðŸ˜€</p>

<p>Here's my old workstation on the right side of the case. I know the cable management is messy, but you have to think I have 2 full ATX systems in this case so the cables have to go somewhere right? Honestly, the cable management doesn't really matter since I have 18 fans in this case. I also bought an adapter for my DSLR camera (used as a webcam) to mount it on an old arm that I had for a mic.</p>

<p>With this change, I even bought new cables for my monitors and I re-ran all of them to hide them as much as possible. (I spent $80 on fucking cables for just my monitors!)</p>

<p>until next time</p>
