<p>I've continued working on a major feature in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_In_Hell_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NMRiH2</a> and it's coming together quite well. I'm very excited to be working with this team. I'm now on phase 4 of this feature.</p>
<p>I decided to also build a new desk so more on that soon. I bought some tools that I should've had for a long time - such as a drill, stud finder, and a laser level. I also bought 1000ft of cat6 even though at the time of writing this I just needed ~1ft of cable for a quick run. Oh well, it was only $130 for 1000ft.</p>
<p>I didn't go with <a href="https://js.wiki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiJS</a> like I spoke about in the last post, instead, I chose <a href="https://www.redmine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redmine</a> as that contains everything I need plus we use it for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_In_Hell_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NMRiH2</a>.</p>
<p>until next time</p>
