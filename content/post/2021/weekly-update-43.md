<p>The week started off with no power for ~24 hours and no internet for ~48 hours. When the internet was restored Tuesday I just watched YouTube. I pretty much only watched YouTube all week.</p>
<p>I did work on a contract this week, it was something that took ~2 hours and I'll be open-sourcing it soon as it's not a major plugin under NDA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
