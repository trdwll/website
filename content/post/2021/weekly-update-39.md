<p>I worked on my project this week and even started a new web project. More on the web project soon - just know it's a useful web project.</p>
<p>I refactored and optimized my inventory system this week. Before it was using FString for ItemIDs and now it's using uint16/int32 (for BP). I've also shrunk my structs that I replicate so I'm now replicating fewer data. I'm looking into better more optimized methods of replicating arrays so when I figure that out I'll write about that next week.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
