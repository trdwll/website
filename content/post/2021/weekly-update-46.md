<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This week I've been working on the game again. I ripped out the old weapon system (wasn't designed that well) and implemented the first new iteration. I haven't spoken about the inventory system in some time so I figured why not bring it up again. I just have like 5 things to finish for the inventory such as item stacking or key binds (such as split a stack or move all items of a type). I've also been researching save systems so I can store game data in the database. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to do it, but it's going to be in JSON.</p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5. In theory, this will be a game-changer (no pun intended) for what I'm trying to accomplish for this game. From what I've seen already I think it's going to be awesome. Time will tell. I just hope UE5 doesn't have developers that become lazier with optimizations.</p>
<p>I've also been playing so much American Truck Simulator. I bought a wheel and it's amazing.</p>
<p>I hope to have some stuff that I can share in about a month, but I can't promise. I'm very excited about what I'm making and can't wait to share it.</p>

<p>until next time</p>
