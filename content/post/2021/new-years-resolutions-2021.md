<p>I wrote one of these last year so I figured why not go ahead and write another one for 2021 to see if I actually follow through with them.</p>

<h3>Facebook</h3>
<p>Since the election in the US, I've stopped using Facebook. I check it once every few days to reply to a few people. I keep getting emails about friend suggestions. I think Facebook checks your last activity date and then starts to spam you with shit to try to get you back on the site. (not working on me ðŸ˜€)</p>
<p>As of December 10, 2020, I've deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts. (I didn't really use them anyway)</p>
<h3>Scuba Diving</h3>
<p>For several years I've wanted to learn to dive so I'd like to make that a reality in 2021.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>For the past 2 years, I've eaten more fast food than I ever have and I hate that. In 2021 I plan to stop eating out as much or even fully and get healthier on that front.</p>
<h3>Profession</h3>
<p>Looking back a couple of years I can see the skills that I had and compared to now I'm certainly better. <em>(right?)</em> In 2021 I'd like to become much better at math and writing code.</p>
<h3>Release a Game</h3>
<p>Last year in December I was apart of releasing a game. I'd like to be apart of releasing another game this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
