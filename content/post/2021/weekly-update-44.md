<p>Last weekend is the first time I went fishing for several years. I didn't catch anything, but my mom went with me and she caught a bluegill. ðŸ˜€ I'm going fishing again this weekend so maybe I'll catch something.</p>
<p>This week I worked on cleaning up some systems in my game. I started on implementing lootable actors (aka chests) and it's in and working. Once I finish up some smaller things then I'm going to start doing weekly goals, because right now I just work on anything and don't exactly get much done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
