<p>Welp, I've written 52 of these posts now so that's a year's worth! I wish I would've stuck with it each week, but honestly, most of them would've been the same shit every week. Thanks for taking the time to read my blog.</p>
<p>This week I finished up phase 4 and started on phase 5. (I was stuck on a replication issue with GetOwner, but I ended up coming up with a different design for this system) Phase 5 is coming along well but will take I'm estimating a month.</p>
<p>I started laying out the design for a smaller personal project that I probably won't end up doing as I'm short on time, but it's fun to design new games. This new game is low poly art with some procgen elements - it's a tycoon game also. My main project is on hold for the time being as is most of my Unreal plugins.</p>
<p>I built a new desk also - I know I already said that in previous posts, but here it is now. It's an up-desk - built using an 8' (cut down to 6.5') butcherblock top with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H46VYRH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VIVO White Electric Dual Motor Stand Up Desk Frame</a> and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086WR9P86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new monitor mount</a>.</p>
