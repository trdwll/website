<p>Here we are almost 4 months into 2022 and I haven't written a weekly update - how dare I?</p>
<p>So I've been super busy with work... and I haven't wanted to write for a while. We're closing in on our release date in October so we're all working hard to complete stuff for the release. </p>
<p>I recently revived my old project (the one that I spoke about the inventory). Since working on NMRiH2 I've learned some new techniques so I decided to revive the project and apply the new techniques. The last time I worked on this project I was unemployed so we'll see how far it goes this time - hell I might hire someone to help out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
