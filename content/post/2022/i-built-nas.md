<p>I ended up deciding to build a NAS as OVH pissed me off with the throttling me when uploading. I've also wanted to build a NAS for a while.</p>
<p>Really the biggest thing that pushed me to pull the trigger was when I came across an amazing deal on eBay. For $430 I got the following:</p>

<p>I wish I could've got the drives a bit cheaper, but they declined my offers so I picked them up at $360 apiece. Ouch! üôÅ</p>
<p>The total cost was around $4k.</p>

<p>Building in the case was a pain in the ass. I read that you'll get cut on the sharp metal and it was true. I had some small cuts - it looked like I was playing with my cat when I was done.</p>
<p>I'm running TrueNAS 12 currently and it's doing just fine. The nvme is being used as a cache drive also.</p>
<p>The reviews for the PSU were mostly people bitching about the loud fan. The fan in this one is super quiet, so I have no idea what they're talking about. I guess it's people that have never heard an SFF fan before - it's honestly super quiet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>until next time</p>
