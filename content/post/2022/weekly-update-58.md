<p>f. It's been over a month since I started the weekly updates again. So much for the name huh?</p>
<p>Give me a break, I've been really busy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been not only busy with NMRiH2, but my own project. You know, the project that I worked on before getting hired by Lever Games - the project that I kept refactoring the inventory? Yeah, that one. I've been making really good progress every weekend. The inventory is just about complete.</p>
<p>I've also been doing a ton of project planning for my game and hell, I even formed the LLC and threw some money into it this time. More on this later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to work.</p>
<p>until next time</p>
