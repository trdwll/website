<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Russ Treadwell and I go by trdwll. I'm a 28 (1995) year old software engineer with an interest in web development and game development. The username trdwll is my last name without vowels.</p>
<p>I'm a technology enthusiast with over a decade of experience. I'm a self-taught programmer with a background in C++, C#, and Python. I enjoy rapid prototyping, writing clean consistent code, and helping out my peers. I'm interested in game engine architecture, game development, and backend web development.</p>
<p>Feel free to write me <a href="mailto:russ@trdwll.com">russ@trdwll.com</a> or take a look at my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/trdwll">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>In my spare time, not only do I love programming, but I love binge-watching TV shows, going to the shooting range, and of course, playing some games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
